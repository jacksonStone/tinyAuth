# tinyauth
Secure, Simple, not scalable, but also not dependent on a database service: Authentication.

When you're fairly certain you'll have less than 1000 users needing to login to a system or set of systems.

Just push this sucker up to heroku, and make https requests against it and you're off to the races.

Please try to use HTTPS when connceting to this/propping up this service... otherwise it kind of defeats the purpose.
